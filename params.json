I am really enjoying working in [Go](https://golang.org/), and hope to use it more in the future.\r\n\r\n### Interests:\r\n\r\n* Linux Storage Systems\r\n* High Performance Computing\r\n* Hiking\r\n* Going off road in the Jeep!\r\n\r\n### About me:\r\n\r\nI live in beautiful [Portland, OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland%2C_Oregon)  \r\nI like to hike in the [Forest Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Park_(Portland,_Oregon)) area with the family  \r\nAnd visit the [Oregon Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Coast) for a short family weekend getaway  \r\ncontact me: ben.mcclelland@gmail.com\r\n\r\n[Ben's GPG key](http://benmcclelland.github.io/Ben.asc)  \r\nfingerprint = DC1F 2FD4 825E 483E 624D BFE2 1E3E 0E80 C693 E0C3",
